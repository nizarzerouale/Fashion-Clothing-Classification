# Clothing Classification using CNN

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying clothing items using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow and Keras in Python. It demonstrates the process of developing, evaluating, and using CNNs for the task, including robust testing frameworks, model improvement strategies, saving/loading models for predictions, and evaluating performance using accuracy and loss metrics.

## Features
- Development of a CNN model for clothing classification.
- Use of K-fold cross-validation for evaluating machine learning models.
- Application of data preprocessing techniques suitable for CNN training.
- Exploration of model architectures and hyperparameters for optimal performance.
- Implementation of model saving/loading for making predictions on new data.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- scikit-learn

## Dataset
The project utilizes the Fashion-MNIST dataset by Zalando, which includes 60,000 training and 10,000 test grayscale images of 10 clothing categories. Each image is 28x28 pixels.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have all the required libraries installed.
3. Run the `FashionRecognition.py` script to start the training and evaluation process. Adjustments to the script can be made to explore different model architectures and parameters.

## Results
The project findings underscore the effectiveness of CNNs in image classification tasks, with specific focus on clothing item recognition. Through various exercises, insights into the impact of convolutional filters, neuron counts in dense layers, and training epochs on model performance are provided. Additionally, techniques like K-fold cross-validation, data normalization, and one-hot encoding of class labels are demonstrated to be crucial for achieving high accuracy.

## Conclusion
This project offers a comprehensive exploration into using CNNs for clothing classification, highlighting the importance of careful data preparation, model architecture selection, and hyperparameter tuning. The experiments conducted provide a foundation for understanding how to effectively deploy CNNs in practical image classification scenarios.
